	Ned Garrison clutched his chest and staggered back several steps, accidentally tossing his cane against the side of the refrigerator, causing it to clank against the floor. He tried to push out words, a scream, a gasp...anything, but all air left his lungs with the fright he just received. His legs jutted outward unnaturally as they tried to find footing, but instead his tired moccasin slipper tangled itself around the fallen cane, whipping it around into Ned's other leg and finally sending the old man to the floor. His weight crashed against the linoleum, a direct blow to his left hip. He finally cried out in pain, fearful of the sharp, shooting, unnatural electricity stabbing down his femur through his knee. 
	He clutched at his hip and grimaced for just long enough to regain control of his breath, then opened his eyes to search the kitchen for his wife. It was her--he was absolutely certain. Nothing else could have scared him more. He whipped his head in every direction he could, but his perspective from the ground was far too limited. He tried to stand, but only got as far as sitting before he had to stop, crying out in pain and aggravation. His hip had to be broken. It was every stubborn old man's worst nightmare. 
	He found his cane next to him. It was a trusty old wooden cane, carved by his grandfather in swirling, spiraling patterns and adorned with stripes of pale and dark stain chasing each other down its length. If owning such a beautiful piece weren't such a great source of pride for Ned, his pride would've kept him from using any device to help him walk altogether. Carefully, though his hand was still shaking beyond his control, he picked up his beloved heirloom in both hands and shoved it tip-down into the kitchen floor. Using every ounce of strength, he pulled his upper body above the top of the cane and pulled his suffering left thigh up off the ground. With all of his weight on the right leg, he grunted and heaved himself over the top of the cane, bringing his body finally to standing. 
	Leaning to his left, he tested his leg. In the moment before he rested any weight down, a confidence surged through him. The pain was dull--tolerable, even. But as soon as he relaxed himself onto the left foot, the sensation of someone shooting a nail gun into his hip forced a yelp to jump from his throat. 
	"Ya think it's broke, Neddy?" came a familiar voice came a voice from over Ned's shoulder that sent shivers of both love and terror through his soul. "T'would be a damn shame if it were. Might have to put you in one of them nursing homes if such a thing happened." 
	Ned sighed. In the very first moment he heard the voice, excitement and fear flooded his senses. After hearing the voice's message, a practiced annoyance that only sixty-one years of marriage could muster up took over. 
	"Dammit, Dottie! Ain't you dead or ain't you dead?" 
	A strange, cold sensation moved through Ned's back and out through his chest, like a frozen crystal sheet waved its way between every cell in his body as it made its way through. As soon as the experience was over, Ned's body returned to its normal state of stressed warmth. 
	What stood in front of him was Dottie. But it wasn't quite Dottie. And it couldn't be Dottie--of that he felt certain. But whatever this Dottie-looking thing was, It sure gave him the same stink-eye he had gotten from his wife nearly every day for the past several decades. 
	The Dottie-looking presence even put a hand on its hip in a perfect dance of Dottie disapproval before it spoke. 
	"Yeah, I'm dead. No thanks to you. Coulda been enjoyin' heaven and all its rewards going on a year now if it weren't for you and your big ideas contrary to mine." 
	Hearing his wife accuse him of wrongdoing he disagreed about making erased all fears and kicked Ned into a defensive mode honed over a half century of practice. He pointed a stout finger at the apparition of his wife. 
	"Now see here, I saved your life, I'll have you know." 
	Dottie's face contorted into a shocked surprise worthy of an award. 
	"Oh!" she cried. "And that's why I've come to visit you in my oh-so-dead state! I wanted to thank you!" Her feigned gratitude transitioned swiftly into sharp, sarcastic, accurate rage. "That year I spent as a vegetable in a nursing home was EXACTLY WHAT I TOLD YOU I NEVER WANTED!" 
	Ned guffawed.
	"How was I supposed to know that you'd be a vegetable? The way the doctors talked, they made it seem like I'd be abusing you if I didn't give you a chance!"
	"A chance? At what, Ned? I was eighty-six years old! You wanted me to go through rehab in case I had enough years left to learn piano?" 
	"But you were alive! I couldn't kill you!" 
	"Ya sent me to surgery when I was dyin'! How many times had I told ya to LET ME DIE?" 
	Ned grimaced. 
	"Well, that was all fine to talk about in a casual manner, but damn, woman! Put yourself in my position! They told me you'd die if you didn't get the surgery!" 
	"They told you that I would most likely be in a nursing home AT BEST if the surgery worked! WHAT DID I TELL YOU ABOUT NURSING HOMES?" 
	Ned fell quiet after staring at the ground and sighing. Dottie floated down to the ground to meet his gaze, but he avoided it. Dottie kept drifting into Ned's field of vision as he tried helplessly to look away from her. Finally, he shut his eyes as tightly as he could. 
	Undeterred, Dottie put her ghostly mouth as close to Ned's ear as she could. He could hear her, but made no effort to move away. He knew what she had to say. He knew what he had coming. He even mouthed the words along with her as she spoke, seeing as how she told him this exact statement more times than he could recall. 
	"I said," said Dottie. Ned nodded and moved his lips along with the chorus like an all-too-often scolded child. "If you ever put me in one of them nursing homes, I'll haunt your ass 'til kingdom come."
